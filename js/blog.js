      takeaways: [
        'Mechanical tension is the undisputed primary driver of myofibrillar hypertrophy.',
        'Taking working sets within 1–3 reps of true muscular failure (RIR 1-3) produces optimal stimulus.',
        'Volume should be calculated as hard sets per muscle group (10–20 weekly sets is the sweet spot).',
        'Progressive overload must be verified across 4-week mesocycles rather than session-by-session ego-lifting.'

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold uppercase text-white mb-4">1. The Mechanical Tension Hierarchy</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">For decades, bodybuilding lore focused heavily on the "pump" (metabolic stress) and muscle soreness (muscle damage). However, research spearheaded by Dr. Brad Schoenfeld and Chris Beardsley has demonstrated that <strong>mechanical tension</strong> experienced by individual muscle fibers during active contraction is the sole trigger for intracellular signaling pathways like mTORC1.</p>
        
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">When a muscle contracts against high resistance (or against moderate resistance as fatigue accumulates), the nervous system recruits high-threshold motor units. These fast-twitch fibers produce the greatest hypertrophy response when subjected to slow contraction speeds under load.</p>

        <div class="p-6 bg-slate-900 border-l-4 border-orange-500 rounded-r-xl my-6">
          <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-white uppercase mb-2">Key Rule of Proximity to Failure</h4>
          <p class="text-slate-300 text-sm mb-0">Sets terminated 5 or more reps away from failure offer negligible hypertrophic stimulus for trained lifters. Target <strong>1 to 3 Reps in Reserve (RIR)</strong> on compound movements, and 0–1 RIR on isolation movements.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold uppercase text-white mb-4">2. Volume Thresholds: Finding Your Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV)</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">More is not always better. Doing 30 sets for chest in a single workout results in excessive muscle damage that impairs protein synthesis and extends recovery past 96 hours. For 90% of lifters, 10 to 18 high-quality sets per muscle group spread across 2–3 weekly sessions yields maximal growth.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold uppercase text-white mb-4">3. Practical Application at Namma Gym</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">In our Barbell & Strength cycles, we prioritize exercises with high stability and great resistance profiles: barbell back squats, stiff-leg deadlifts, incline dumbbell presses, and chest-supported rows. Track your loads inside our Member Portal to ensure continuous progression.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold uppercase text-white mb-4">1. The Push-Step (Step & Slide)</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">The foundational movement of all pugilism. When moving forward, push off your rear ball of foot and step with your lead. When retreating, push off the lead and step with the rear. This ensures your base never narrows and you are perpetually grounded to strike or defend.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold uppercase text-white mb-4">2. The 45-Degree Pendulum Cut</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Moving in straight lines makes you predictable. By cutting 45 degrees outside your opponent's lead hand, you exit their power line while opening up devastating liver shots and straight right hands.</p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">When an opponent charges straight forward, plant your lead foot, pivot your rear leg 90 degrees like opening a swinging gate, and deliver a short lead hook. The opponent's forward momentum magnifies the impact.</p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Consuming all your protein in one giant meal is suboptimal for Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS). To trigger the leucine trigger (~3g of leucine per serving), aim for 30–45g of high-quality protein every 3 to 4 hours.</p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Carbohydrates are your muscles' primary anaerobic fuel during intense lifting and combat rounds.
